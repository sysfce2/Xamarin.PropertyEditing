      Disable MicroBuild signing by default, then only enable it after compilation.
      This way, if compilation is skipped because it the project has already been built, signing
      will remain turned off and we will not redundantly submit already-signed files to sign.

      This property group must remain in Directory.Build.targets file (as opposed to *.props) because
      the initial MicroBuild_SigningEnabled value is not set until after Directory.Build.props has been processed.

      Disable MicroBuild signing by default, then only enable it after compilation.
      This way, if compilation is skipped because it the project has already been built, signing
      will remain turned off and we will not redundantly submit already-signed files to sign.

      This property group must remain in Directory.Build.targets file (as opposed to *.props) because
      the initial MicroBuild_SigningEnabled value is not set until after Directory.Build.props has been processed.

  By creating this target, we can ensure SignNugetFiles will run before SignFiles.
  This ensures the output files (signed by SignFiles) will still look "more recent" than
  the nuget files (signed by SignNugetFiles), which are considered inputs to the project.
  If we don't do this and SignNugetFiles runs first, the inputs look more recent than the outputs and the
  project will be rebuilt unnecessarily.
